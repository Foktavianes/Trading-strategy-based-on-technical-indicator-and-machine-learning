# Trading-strategy-based-on-technical-indicator-and-machine-learning
The background of this project is creation of trading strategy that beat the S&P 500 returns from 2003 to 2022. 
The returns of S&P 500 in this time period is around 500% or cumulative sum of 5.
In the script, I used class to build the trading strategy. Also, I applied several methods for my trading strategy, such as RSI, MACD, mean-reversion and several machine learning algos. 

The final result is shown below:
